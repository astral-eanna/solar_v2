In a world where the clamor of echoed conformity drowns out individuality, Alternative Space Blog emerges as a beacon for those seeking a departure from conventional space discourse. We believe in the untapped potential of alternative perspectives, aiming to cultivate greater diversity in our collective cosmic imagination.

Founded with a mission to explore the often-overlooked realms of space, our digital voyage commenced in the tail-end of 2023. Just as the inspiration for this blog, [Low-tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com), harnessed the power of the sun with a solar-powered server, we too embrace a self-hosted approach that liberates our content from the constraints of mainstream platforms.

Alternative Space Blog is not merely a digital space; it's a cosmic sanctuary where the interplay of diverse ideas and perspectives creates new ground for space-bound ideas to emerge.

Join us on this journey as we challenge the boundaries of space discourse and invite you to reimagine the vast universe that lies beyond the ordinary.
